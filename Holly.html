          <p>Many sources and organizations have noted a significant increase in the notion of surveillance and increased security; there has been a substantial increase in the number of cameras that could litter one’s daily route and the software each camera uses. To some people, the increased surveillance is a comfort and is there not only to assist if something bad has happened but as a method to deter people from committing crimes. This is the argument that most governments and public figures use when they make a call for increasing public surveillance; it is also responsible for the successful market of home cameras, such as Blink and Ring. The argument against increased surveillance often comes down to privacy, not only privacy for what one does but where they go. Increased public and private cameras mean that someone’s movements can be tracked and pieced together.
</p>

          <br>
          <p>There are very few ways to combat being surveilled and tracked through cameras. Very few people, if anyone at all, has the luxury to be able to avoid cameras every day. We must go to work, to the grocery store, to the pharmacy, then there are the places we want to go to: the mall, restaurants and bars, and entertainment venues such as stadiums and theaters. We have no control over our surveillance.
</p>
          <br>
          <p>To take back some control, several different artists have created masks that inhibit facial recognition software in order to help one move freely and avoid tracking. These masks either cover areas of the face, make it appear altered, or project a new face (look). Initially, when everyone began wearing masks to help prevent the spread of Covid-19, some types of facial recognition were unable to distinguish faces. As time passed, the technology was adapted to work even with a face mask. The most notable example of this is Apple’s Face ID can now recognize you with a mask on to unlock your phone.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Facial recognition works in three steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First, the technology must detect a face. </li>
            <li>Second, the technology maps points on the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. It measures the shape of different features and the distance between them.</li>
            <li>Finally, with a more detailed analysis, the technology tries to identify the person by comparing the points to a database of images. </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>In order to make a mask that would be able to thwart facial recognition, there are many ways it could be approached. The mask could disguise the shape of the face so the technology could not detect a face, or the mask could hide the features of the face so they could not be accurately recognized and measured.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I chose to make a mask that would do both; the fabric of the mask is boxy and longer than the face in order to mask the shape of the face. It is also wide enough to hide the ears, which is often an indicator of the location of facial features. If the face would be able to be detected, the textured of the fabrics and the lines of the seams contrast the natural lines of the face. While I made this mask as more of an art piece, it is practical. This mask was tested against Apple’s Face ID by five different people, none of which were recognized. Face ID is able to identify faces by measuring the depths of the face and mapping them. Apple has recently updated its technology to recognize features around the eyes to be effective while the subject is wearing a mask.</p>
          <br>
          <p>As mentioned, I made this mask to be a piece of art rather than something I would wear regularly. What I make is a reflection of my identity as an artist and as the person I am beyond my art. Making a mask to protect my identity complements how I identify as an artist. When showing and displaying my art, I choose to remain anonymous by using a pseudonym and as a writer, I only write under a pen name. I no longer have control over my art once it is put into the world, the intent of the artist is often overshadowed by the intent of the owner.</p>
          <br>
         <p>This idea of making a mask that creates a new idea is an extension of the practice of personalizing and customizing Covid face masks that is already very popular. It is important that we as a society are aware of the increased effectiveness of facial recognition that is inhibiting our ability to retain privacy. At the beginning of the pandemic, many people took it upon themselves to make their own face masks because that’s the only thing they could do to protect themselves. Applying that mindset to masks to deter facial recognition, the physical labor and materials needed are not much more than what is needed to make your own mask to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I did not want this mask to be completely impersonal so when designing the mask, I chose the materials based on colors that are most prevalent in my wardrobe. We say a lot about who we are and what we like in how we dress and present ourselves. When choosing materials, I was forced to pick materials that could be seen through and were breathable. With that in mind, I was limited in what materials could be used. After surveying what I wear regularly, I found I wear greens, purples, oranges, greasy, and blacks. The size of the sections correlates to which color I favor more on a daily basis. This mask is using my wardrobe and fashion choices, which I consider a way of self-expression and part of my identity, to create a new identity. There is a certain harmony that a mask that protects my identity is made of something that is part of that identity.
